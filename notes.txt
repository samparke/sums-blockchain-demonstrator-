How we interact with Ethereum:
Wagmi -> Viem -> Ethereum node providers -> Nodes -> Ethereum 
Alternatively, you can operate your own node, instead of using node providers like Alchemy.


-----------------------------------------------------------
Wagmi -> Viem 

Wagmi is a library whch provides React hooks to interact with 




I like to use analogies to explain how these tools interact.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Ethereum nodes providers (Alchemy, Infura) -> Ethereum:

Alchemy and Infura operate and manage nodes for developers who don't own nodes themselves. 
Nodes are 


Ethereum is a decentralised public court archive, which contains legal contracts (smart contracts).
Nodes, like Alchemy, are like your law clerk with special access.
They know how the courts work, have a direct line to the archive room and can send documents (transactions),
and retrieve data (contract data) on your behalf.

Viem -> Ethereum node providers (Alchemy, Infura)

Interfaces and developer tools allow interaction with a blockchain (Ethereum in this instance).
An analogy: interacting with Ethereum is like walking down a path with multiple gates (or layers).
Each layer simplifies or allows access to the next.

I use:
- Viem (the final gateway that sends low-level RPC requests to an Ethereum node (such as Alchemy) - such as reading and writing)
- Wagmi (the gateway to Viem. It wraps Viem in React hooks - like useAccount(). )
- RainbowKit (the gateway to Wagmi. It provides a user-friendly UI for wallet selection and connection ("connect wallet"). )
